            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p><img src="resources/images/Ania buisness picture.png" alt="Headshot photo of Ania" class="left" height="450px" width="350px">Hey! My name is Ania (Username: Ania da Peasant) and I’m currently a 19-year-old college student living in Melbourne Australia.</p>

              <p>For the last 4 years, I’ve been involved in creating content for Youtube. My videos are transformative as I, with permission, take comics and incorperate my voice acting and video editing skills to turn an image into a moving video. Now as a student I want to build myself up with skills and knowledge so I’ve decided to create a portfolio to show what skills I currently have and who I am as a person.</p>
              
              <p>Any and all the work that I currently do I want to do for free as for me right now the most important thing is learning, building skills and the ability to put it into my portfolio and say ‘I’ve made this and my client is satisfied with it’.</p>
              
              <p>Originally I planned to describe in words the last few years online but I struggled to come up with the right words so I created a video about it which is <a href="https://youtu.be/LJ6gBXJ_0jw">linked here.</a></p>
              
              <p>So instead I shall write down my motivations and goals, not only so you can understand me more as a person but so I can look back at the words to remind myself what I’m working towards. To an outside person, they may seem selfish or be weird in nature but in the end, it is still my own goals. </p>
